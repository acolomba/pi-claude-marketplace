Feature: Hook project provenance

  A project-scope hook runs only when the user installed its plugin into the project, as Claude Code
  skips a plugin that only the repository's files name. Pi trusts a project that holds no pi settings
  file, so trust alone cannot tell the two apart. A local marketplace, a scripted model, and a hook
  that records each run stand in for published ones.

  Background:
    Given pi runs with the scripted model
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" is published as a dir source
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" offers these plugins:
      | name | version |
      | demo | 1.0.0   |
    Given the published plugin "demo" of the marketplace "fixtures" has these hooks, each recording its runs:
      | name       | event      | matcher |
      | bash-guard | PreToolUse | Bash    |
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" is added to the project scope
    Given the user has run "/claude:plugin install demo@fixtures --scope project"

  Scenario: A project hook whose install the user's pi directory does not record does not run
    Given the user's pi directory records no hook install for the project
    Given the user has started a new pi session
    Given the scripted model plays these steps:
      | reply | tool | arguments                      |
      |       | bash | {"command": "echo from-model"} |
      | Done. |      |                                |
    When the user prompts "run the echo"
    Then the hooks record no runs
    Then the model receives these calls:
      | call | role        | text                                         |
      | 1    | user        | run the echo                                 |
      | 2    | user        | run the echo                                 |
      | 2    | assistant   | tool call bash {"command":"echo from-model"} |
      | 2    | tool result | bash returned: from-model\n                  |

  Scenario: A project hook whose staged file changed after the install does not run
    Given the staged hooks file of the project plugin "demo" was rewritten on one line
    Given the user has started a new pi session
    Given the scripted model plays these steps:
      | reply | tool | arguments                      |
      |       | bash | {"command": "echo from-model"} |
      | Done. |      |                                |
    When the user prompts "run the echo"
    Then the hooks record no runs
    Then the model receives these calls:
      | call | role        | text                                         |
      | 1    | user        | run the echo                                 |
      | 2    | user        | run the echo                                 |
      | 2    | assistant   | tool call bash {"command":"echo from-model"} |
      | 2    | tool result | bash returned: from-model\n                  |

  Scenario: A project hook whose install the user's pi directory does not record runs after a reinstall
    Given the user's pi directory records no hook install for the project
    Given the user has run "/claude:plugin reinstall demo@fixtures --scope project"
    Given the user has started a new pi session
    Given the scripted model plays these steps:
      | reply | tool | arguments                      |
      |       | bash | {"command": "echo from-model"} |
      | Done. |      |                                |
    When the user prompts "run the echo"
    Then the hooks record these runs:
      | event      | session | tool name | tool input                    | cwd           | transcript path | arguments  | CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR | CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT                        | CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA                                | CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID | CLAUDE_SESSION_ID | CLAUDECODE |
      | PreToolUse | first   | Bash      | {"command":"echo from-model"} | {project dir} |                 | bash-guard | {project dir}      | {home}/marketplaces/fixtures/plugins/demo | {project dir}/.pi/pi-claude-marketplace/data/demo | first                  | first             | 1          |
    Then the model receives these calls:
      | call | role        | text                                         |
      | 1    | user        | run the echo                                 |
      | 2    | user        | run the echo                                 |
      | 2    | assistant   | tool call bash {"command":"echo from-model"} |
      | 2    | tool result | bash returned: from-model\n                  |

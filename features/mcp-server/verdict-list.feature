Feature: MCP server verdict list

  A plugin's list row follows the MCP implementation pi runs when the list is
  read, not the one it ran at install (MREC-03, D-P3-05), so a switch needs no
  reinstall. A local marketplace stands in for a published one, and each sse
  server points at a loopback port that nothing listens on.

  @adapter-only
  Scenario: An installed plugin with an sse server lists as installed, under pi-mcp-adapter (MREC-03)
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" is published as a dir source
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" offers these plugins:
      | name | version |
      | demo | 1.0.0   |
    Given the published plugin "demo" of the marketplace "fixtures" has the file ".mcp.json" with this text:
      """
      {"mcpServers": {"events": {"type": "sse", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:9/sse"}}}
      """
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" is added to the project scope
    Given the user has run "/claude:plugin install demo@fixtures --scope project", which did not fail
    When the user runs "/claude:plugin list"
    Then the result has these fields:
      | kind                | cascade     |
      | severity            | info        |
      | needs reload        | false       |
      | tally label         | Plugin list |
      | tally failures      | 0           |
      | tally warnings      | 0           |
      | tally success count | 1           |
    Then the result lists these plugins:
      | marketplace name | marketplace scope | id            | name | status    | reasons | scope   | version |
      | fixtures         | project           | demo@fixtures | demo | installed |         | project | 1.0.0   |

  @builtin-only
  Scenario: An installed plugin with an sse server lists as partially installed, under Pi's built-in MCP (MREC-03)
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" is published as a dir source
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" offers these plugins:
      | name | version |
      | demo | 1.0.0   |

      """
      {"mcpServers": {"events": {"type": "sse", "url": "http://127.0.0.1:9/sse"}}}
      """
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" is added to the project scope
    Given the user has run "/claude:plugin install demo@fixtures --scope project --partial", which did not fail
    When the user runs "/claude:plugin list"
    Then the result has these fields:
      | kind                | cascade     |
      | severity            | info        |
      | needs reload        | false       |

      | tally failures      | 0           |
      | tally warnings      | 0           |
      | tally success count | 1           |
    Then the result lists these plugins:

      | fixtures         | project           | demo@fixtures | demo | partially-installed | unsupported mcp | project | 1.0.0   |

  @own-implementation
  Scenario: A plugin installed under pi-mcp-adapter lists as partially installed when pi runs its built-in MCP instead, with no reinstall (MREC-03)
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" is published as a dir source
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" offers these plugins:
      | name | version |
      | demo | 1.0.0   |

    Given the marketplace "fixtures" is added to the project scope
    Given the user has run "/claude:plugin install demo@fixtures --scope project", which did not fail
    Given pi runs with the scripted model
    When the user runs "/claude:plugin list"
    Then the result has these fields:

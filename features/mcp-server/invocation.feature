Feature: MCP server invocation

  A plugin's MCP server is reached through pi-mcp-adapter, and the model
  receives what the server returns. A stdio stub server stands in for a real
  one, a scripted model for a real model, and a local marketplace for a
  published one.

  Scenario: A scripted call through the mcp tool reaches the plugin's server and returns its result
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" is published as a dir source
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" offers these plugins:
      | name | version |
      | demo | 1.0.0   |
    Given the published plugin "demo" of the marketplace "fixtures" has the stub mcp server "stub"
    Given the marketplace "fixtures" is added to the user scope
    Given the user has run "/claude:plugin install demo@fixtures --scope user", which warned
    Given pi runs with the scripted model and these companions:
      | companion      |
      | pi-mcp-adapter |
    Given pi-mcp-adapter has listed the tools of the stub mcp server "stub" of the plugin "demo"
    Given the scripted model plays these steps:
      | reply | tool | arguments                                                          |
      |       | mcp  | {"tool": "mcp__plugin_demo_stub__echo", "args": {"text": "ping"}} |
      | Done. |      |                                                                    |
    When the user prompts "call the stub"
    Then the stub mcp server "stub" of the plugin "demo" receives these messages:

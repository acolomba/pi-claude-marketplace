# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-09-13 after the refine-unit-tests milestone)

**Core value:** A Pi user can install a Claude plugin and load each supported
component as a working Pi artifact.

**Current focus:** None. No milestone is active — define the next one with
`/gsd-new-milestone`.

## Current Position

Phase: Not started (defining requirements)
Plan: —
Status: Defining requirements
Last activity: 2026-09-14 — Milestone test-backlog started

### Closeout type: `override_closeout`

Two reasons, neither an outcome failure.

1. **`init.manager` reports eight of nine phases `stale`.** This is a timestamp
   verdict, not an outcome verdict. Their `covered_files` include
   `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and `STATE.md`, which every later plan rewrites,
   so re-verifying re-stales them and the loop never converges. All nine
   `VERIFICATION.md` files read `status: passed` with full scores.
2. **Four open artifacts were acknowledged at close.** Known verification
   overrides: **4 newly acknowledged, 17 carried forward** from a prior close.

## Known Risk Worth Revisiting

`IN-03` from the Phase 9 code review. **NFR-10 path containment now rests on an
injected collaborator honoring a prose-only contract that nothing type-enforces.**
`IN-01` and `IN-04` are also open by choice but carry no comparable risk.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close, most recent first.

### The phase-25 table limitation is FIXED

v1.19's close disclosed one item the tool could not suppress: phase 25's deferred
items lived in a markdown **table**, and the scanner synthesizes a row's `text` by
joining cells with a spaced hyphen while the file stores them with a spaced vertical
bar — so the `acknowledge` writer's literal-text search could never match, and it
refused with `no deferred item matched --text`. That row was disclosed here instead
and was expected to resurface at every future close.

It did resurface, and it is now closed. At this milestone's close the row was
converted to the bullet shape the writer understands, **with every cell preserved
verbatim**, and it acknowledged cleanly. Any future table-shaped deferred item will
hit the same wall; convert it rather than re-disclosing it.

## Session Continuity

**Stopped at:** Milestone `refine-unit-tests` closed and archived on 2026-09-13.

PR #181 merged to main on 2026-09-13, closing the milestone's branch.

Since then, four quick tasks landed on `features/random-refinements`: 260909-h38 made
three cross-process concurrency proofs deterministic, 260913-f6a and 260913-l07
hardened the CI workflows and gated them, and 260913-n7w fixed a reader-pairing race
the first of those introduced. 260913-r2h then closed that harness's remaining over-read hang. That branch is
PR #183, awaiting merge.

Quick task 260913-ttl then landed on `features/100-coverage`: it measured the
SonarQube 98.6% branch reading as ~133 phantom lcov-merge conditions plus one
real branch, retired that branch by narrowing `isErrnoException`, and pointed
`sonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths` at `coverage/unit.lcov` alone — proven
locally at 100.00% line and 100.00% branch coverage. Awaiting PR.

**Next:** merge PR #183, then `/gsd-new-milestone`.

### Known snag for the next close

`gsd-tools query phase.complete` and the state verbs refuse in this checkout: they
see `.planning/workstreams/` and demand `--ws`, but this milestone's ROADMAP and
STATE were the ROOT files and no workstream is named `refine-unit-tests`. Hand-edit
and verify by diff. Two further CLI gaps were worked around at this close and will
recur: `milestone complete` leaves the original-path deletions **unstaged**
(`git add -u .planning/`), and it wrote `completed_phases: 1` / `percent: 11` for a
9-of-9 milestone, which was corrected by hand.

## Operator Next Steps

- Squash-merge PR #183 (all checks green; the repository allows squash merges only)
- Start the next milestone with `/gsd-new-milestone`

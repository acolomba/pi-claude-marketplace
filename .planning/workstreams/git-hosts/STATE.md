# Project State

## Project Reference

**Core value:** A Pi user can run `/claude:plugin install <plugin>@<marketplace>` and, after
`/reload`, have every supported Claude plugin component appear as a working Pi-native artifact —
atomically, recoverably, and with soft-dependency degradation that never blocks the install.

**Current focus:** `any-git-host` reimplements the three real defects PR #153 (jstillwa) surfaced,
rather than merging that PR. A private source on any git host clones with a credential the user
already stored; an endpoint that answers only at its verbatim URL resolves; and `marketplace add`
recovers from its own leftover clone instead of demanding a manual `rm -rf`. The PR's two
Codex-layout changes are out of scope — Claude Code 2.1.274 contains zero references to
`.agents/plugins/` or `.codex-plugin/`.

## Current Position

Phase: 1 — Private repos on any git host (not started)
Plan: —
Status: Roadmap complete — ready to plan Phase 1
Last activity: 2026-09-25 — Roadmap created (3 phases, 10/10 v1 requirements mapped)

The roadmap is written and every v1 requirement is mapped to exactly one phase. No phase directory
exists yet and no plan has been written. Next step is `/gsd-plan-phase 1 --skip-ui`.

## Progress

**Phases Complete:** 0 / 3
**Current Plan:** N/A

```
Phase 1  [          ]  not started
Phase 2  [          ]  not started
Phase 3  [          ]  not started
```

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Private repos on any git host | GAUTH-03, GAUTH-04, GAUTH-05, GAUTH-06 | Not started |
| 2 | Endpoints that answer only at the verbatim URL | MURL-08, MURL-09 | Not started |
| 3 | `marketplace add` recovers from its own leftover clone | MA-12, MA-13, MA-14, GATE-01 | Not started |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- **Phase numbering restarts at 1.** `git-hosts` is a fresh workstream with zero prior phases. The
  repo's shared counter runs to Phase 117 on other workstreams; it does not apply here.
- **Milestone label is a name, not a version.** `any-git-host` follows the `url-source` /
  `force-install` / `workflows` precedent: concurrent workstreams cannot share a global version
  sequence.
- **Three phases, one per defect.** The three defects are independent in behavior but share two
  files (`platform/git.ts`, the `GitOps` seam in `orchestrators/marketplace/shared.ts`), so the
  phases run in sequence rather than in parallel.
- **GAUTH-06 stays in Phase 1 with GAUTH-03.** GAUTH-03 retires the `undefined`-for-no-provider
  refusal that currently stands in as the cross-host leak guard (PROV-04 / T-79-04). Its real
  replacement — a host check inside `onAuth`, which today ignores its `url` argument — must land in
  the same phase, or the milestone opens a window in which a credential bound to one host can
  follow a redirect to another.
- **GATE-01 is mapped to Phase 3** because that is where it is finally measured, but the gate
  surface is a milestone-wide constraint recorded in ROADMAP.md § Milestone-wide constraints and
  must be green at every phase boundary.
- **No new hostname literal in `domain/auth-registry.ts`.** Per-host descriptors for self-hosted
  instances are explicitly out of scope; GAUTH-03 is what makes them unnecessary.

### Source-review facts carried into planning

- `orchestrators/auth-host.ts::buildAuthForHost` returns `GitAuthBundle | undefined` and consults
  `domain/auth-registry.ts::findProviderForHost`, which holds only `GITHUB_PROVIDER` (github.com)
  and `GITLAB_PROVIDER` (gitlab.com), both RFC-8628 Device Flow descriptors.
- `undefined` means `platform/git.ts::clone|fetch|resolveRemoteRef` never call
  `platform/git-auth-callbacks.ts::buildAuthCallbacks`, so `credentialOps.fill(host)` — the
  `git credential fill` shell-out — is never consulted. That is the GAUTH-03 defect.
- `buildAuthCallbacks.onAuth(_url)` already consults `fill(opts.host)` first and only falls through
  to `onAuthRequired()` on a miss. The fix is to always return a bundle and let the registry gate
  only the Device Flow closure — not to add a host descriptor.
- `clone` and `resolveRemoteRef` receive URLs callers already passed through
  `domain/source.ts::ensureGitSuffix`; some smart-HTTP servers answer only at the verbatim path and
  404 the `.git` form (MURL-08).
- `orchestrators/marketplace/add.ts::addGitClonedInGuard` throws `StaleSourceCloneError` whenever
  `sources/<name>/` exists (MA-6), with no way to tell a leftover clone of the same source from a
  foreign tree. Recognizing "same source" needs a new `GitOps.listRemotes` seam in
  `orchestrators/marketplace/shared.ts` and `platform/git.ts`.

### Open TODOs

- Plan Phase 1 with `--skip-ui`: the `ui_safety_gate` keyword scan false-positives on this
  project's domain vocabulary (`form`, `component`, `view`). No phase in this milestone is a UI
  phase.

### Blockers

None.

## Session Continuity

**Stopped At:** Roadmap written for `any-git-host`; no phase directory created, no plan written.
**Resume File:** `.planning/workstreams/git-hosts/ROADMAP.md`
**Next Action:** `/gsd-plan-phase 1 --skip-ui`

# Project State

## Project Reference

See: `.planning/PROJECT.md` (updated 2026-09-18 after the test-backlog milestone)

**Core value:** A Pi user can install a Claude plugin and load each supported
component as a working Pi artifact.

**Current focus:** Planning the next milestone

## Current Position

Phase: Milestone test-backlog complete
Plan: —
Status: test-backlog milestone shipped — PR #202
Last activity: 2026-09-20 — Completed quick task 260920-qx0: `--local` rejected on marketplace info/list/update (it was a no-op on all three merged-read verbs)

### test-backlog closeout: `override_closeout`

Shipped 2026-09-18, no npm release. All eight phases read `status: passed`
(5/5, 4/4, 18/18, 7/7, 10/10, 2/2, 8/8, 7/7); the audit is `tech_debt` with no
blockers (requirements 18/18, phases 8/8, integration 9/9, flows 2/2). Two
override reasons, neither an outcome failure:

1. **`init.manager` reports every phase `stale`** because each `covered_files`
   list names `STATE.md`, `ROADMAP.md` and `REQUIREMENTS.md`, which every later
   close rewrites. Third milestone with this artifact.
2. **Two artifacts acknowledged at close** (the Phase 5 and Phase 6 deferred-item
   records). Known verification overrides: **2 newly acknowledged, 16 carried
   forward**.

The refine-unit-tests close (2026-09-13) carried the same shape: 4 newly
acknowledged, 17 carried forward, and the phase-25 table conversion.

### Known snags for the next close

- `phase.complete` drops `current_phase_name`, resets Current Position to
  `Plan: Not started`, and rewrites the historical `Stopped at:` line under an
  older heading. Restore by hand and check with `git diff`.
- `milestone complete` leaves every original-path deletion **unstaged**
  (`git add -u .planning/phases .planning/quick`) and writes 40 verbose
  accomplishment bullets that need a hand rewrite. `.planning/workstreams/` no
  longer exists, so the verb runs; the earlier `--ws` refusal is gone.
- The `audit-open` line parser stops at a frontmatter list item that begins
  with a backtick, so a complete quick task reads `unknown`, and the
  acknowledge writer then **replaces the whole frontmatter** with its marker.
  Quote the scalar instead of acknowledging; restore the file from git if the
  writer already ran.
- A table-shaped deferred item still cannot be acknowledged; convert it to
  bullets with every cell preserved.
- `state.advance-plan` resets `Status:` and rewrites a historical `Stopped at:`
  line; re-read STATE.md after every state verb.

## Known Risk Worth Revisiting

`IN-03` from the Phase 9 code review. **NFR-10 path containment now rests on an
injected collaborator honoring a prose-only contract that nothing type-enforces.**
`IN-01` and `IN-04` are also open by choice but carry no comparable risk.

### The phase-25 table limitation is FIXED

v1.19's close disclosed one item the tool could not suppress: phase 25's deferred
items lived in a markdown **table**, and the scanner synthesizes a row's `text` by
joining cells with a spaced hyphen while the file stores them with a spaced vertical
bar — so the `acknowledge` writer's literal-text search could never match, and it
refused with `no deferred item matched --text`. That row was disclosed here instead
and was expected to resurface at every future close.

It did resurface, and it is now closed. At this milestone's close the row was
converted to the bullet shape the writer understands, **with every cell preserved
verbatim**, and it acknowledged cleanly. Any future table-shaped deferred item will
hit the same wall; convert it rather than re-disclosing it.

## Session Continuity

**Last session:** 2026-09-20
**Stopped at:** PR #202 green at 100% Sonar coverage (2026-09-20)
**Resume file:** None

**Current work:** none. test-backlog shipped 2026-09-18 on `features/test-backlog`;
PR #202 is pushed with every check green, so the next steps are the merge and
`/gsd-new-milestone`.
Earlier milestone continuity is preserved in
`inputs/test-backlog/PRE-MILESTONE-STATE.md` and archived milestone artifacts.

## Milestones

## Phases

<summary>✅ v1.15 frontmatter-compliance (Phase 86) — SHIPPED 2026-07-27</summary>

- [x] Phase 86: Skill and command frontmatter compliance (5/5 plans) — completed 2026-07-26
  The skills and commands bridges parse source frontmatter with Pi's own
  `parseFrontmatter` before rewriting, never stage bytes Pi rejects, degrade a broken
  skill (synthesized `disable-model-invocation` block, body verbatim) or command
  (neutralized, name-from-filename) at Claude-Code parity, fold a skill's `when_to_use`
  into the description Pi reads, and surface + classify each failure as a warning —
  while the ~99% of already-valid components stay byte-for-byte unchanged (issue #101).

<summary>✅ v1.14 mcp-string-refs (Phase 85) — SHIPPED 2026-07-23</summary>

- [x] Phase 85: `mcpServers` string file-path references (2/2 plans) — completed 2026-07-23
  Resolves a `./`-relative string `mcpServers` (marketplace entry OR `plugin.json`)
  to a wrapped `.mcp.json` inside the plugin root and installs its servers at parity
  with the inline form; a missing / malformed / out-of-root reference isolates that
  one plugin to `(unavailable) {malformed mcp}`, never failing the marketplace load.

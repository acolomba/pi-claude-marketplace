## Phases

<details>
<summary>✅ v1.19 Unit Test Refactor (Phases 108-117) — SHIPPED 2026-09-04</summary>

Every production TypeScript module now has exactly one mirrored owner test that
imports it directly. 204 pairs, corresponding-test gate at zero violations.

## Carried Forward

Two things the next milestone inherits, both deliberate rather than unfinished:

- **Seven accepted D-116-01a shortfalls** — `edge/args.ts`, `edge/completions/data.ts`,
  `edge/completions/provider.ts`, `edge/handlers/marketplace/update.ts`,
  `edge/handlers/plugin/import.ts`, `edge/handlers/plugin/pending.ts` and
  `edge/handlers/shared.ts` each fall exactly one branch short. Five are
  compiler-forced, two structurally unreachable, and `!`/`as` are barred
  throughout `extensions/`, so each closes only by a production rewrite. They are
  pinned by identity in their own pairs and filed as ledger entries 15-19, 21 and
  22. While any of them stands, `npm run test:coverage:direct:all` exits 1 on a
  clean tree by design.
- **Documentation drift from the relocations** — five ledger entries naming test
  paths that phases 117-02/04/05 vacated, plus `.planning/codebase/TESTING.md`
  and `CONVENTIONS.md` describing the pre-refactor tree. None affects a gate; two
  live under `extensions/`, which phase 117 had no licence to touch.

Full ledger: [`.planning/WINDOWS.md`](WINDOWS.md).
